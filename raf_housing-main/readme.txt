You must start by going into the raf-housing-main>raf_housing_backend folder in a CMD and run "npm run dev" to run the backend server.

After that you can start the unity project. Start from scene "Main Menu". From there you can log in with username: simone and password: simone. This should take you to the game screen. Place a few houses down and move the slider. 

Once you press save, it either creates or overrides a "save.json" file inside the raf_housing_backend folder with the slider data, button data, username data and house position/rotaton data. There is also an "event.json" file created for starting and exiting the game.
